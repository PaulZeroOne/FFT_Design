# FFT_ChipDesign
> A 16-point radix-4 FFT chip, including Verilog codes, netlists and layout.



## Features

### Function

- Each input value is a **complex number**, divided into real and imaginary parts;
- Both the real and imaginary parts of inputs are **17 bits**;
  - Bit 16 is the sign bit;
  - Bit 8-15 are decimal bits;
  - Bit 0-7 are integer bits.
- Both the real and imaginary parts of rotation factors are 8 **bits**;
  - Bit 8 is the sign bit;
  - Bit 0-7 are decimal bits;
  - No integer bits, the default is 0.
- Make sure that the FFT function is correct.

## Acknowledgement

- Frist of all, we want to thank ***Prof. He Weifeng***,  his course providing us with the opportunity to learn the complete chip design process, and he also answered the questions we encountered in detail in class. The twice-weekly discussion held by the him during the design workflow greatly helped us optimize our design of the chip and also taught us a lot.
- Then we want to thank ***the assistant Zhang Chao***. The materials provided by him greatly helped us optimize the design of the chip, and he patiently answered all the unknown error messages we encountered throughout the workflow, which helped us a lot.
- And I would like to personally thank ***Zhang Jialing*** of Group 1 and ***Zhang Yunfang*** of Group 4 who also design FFT chips. Although the algorithms we adopt are different, their ideas also have reference value for our optimization. Especially when our design work frequency is too low in the early stage, their two sets of multiplier implementation solutions inspired us to optimize the multiplier.
- Finally, I would also like to thank other assistants and classmates who helped us complete the design and help the course go smoothly.
- In addition, when we didn't know the direction in the early stage, the work of others on **GitHub** and **CSDN** blog also gave us a lot of inspiration. I would like to thank you here.
- Our version management work is also implemented through GitHub. After the project achieved, we adopted the Mozilla 2.0 public license for open source, as a small contribution to the open source community.
